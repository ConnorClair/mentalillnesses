      <h1>Diagnostic Criteria</h1>
      <p><strong>300.22 (F40.00)</strong></p>
      <p>A. Marked fear or anxiety about two (or more) of the following five situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using public transportation (e.g., automobiles, buses, trains, ships, planes).</li>
        <li>Being in open spaces (e.g., parking lots, marketplaces, bridges).</li>
        <li>Being in enclosed places (e.g., shops, theaters, cinemas).</li>
        <li>Standing in line or being in a crowd.</li>
        <li>Being outside of the home alone.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>B. The individual fears or avoids these situations because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fear of falling in the elderly; fear of incontinence).</p>
      <p>C. The agoraphobic situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.</p>
      <p>D. The agoraphobic situations are actively avoided, require the presence of a companion, or are endured with intense fear or anxiety.</p>
      <p>E. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the agoraphobic situations and to the sociocultural context.</p>
      <p>F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.</p>
      <p>G. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</p>
      <p>H. If another medical condition (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson’s disease) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly excessive.</p>
      <p>I. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder—for example, the symptoms are not confined to specific phobia, situational type; do not involve only social situations (as in social anxiety disorder); and are not related exclusively to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder), perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance (as in body dysmorphic disorder), reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder), or fear of separation (as in separation anxiety disorder).</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Agoraphobia is diagnosed irrespective of the presence of panic disorder. If an individual’s presentation meets criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia, both diagnoses should be assigned.</p>

      <h1>Diagnostic Features</h1>
      <p>The essential feature of agoraphobia is marked, or intense, fear or anxiety triggered by the real or anticipated exposure to a wide range of situations. The diagnosis requires endorsement of symptoms occurring in at least two of the following five situations: 1) using public transportation, 2) being in open spaces, 3) being in enclosed spaces, 4) standing in line or being in a crowd, or 5) being outside of the home alone.</p>
      <p>Individuals typically experience thoughts that something terrible might happen, such as difficulty escaping or lack of help in the event of panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms. The fear or anxiety is nearly always provoked by the feared situations, and the individual actively avoids these situations or endures them with intense fear or anxiety.</p>

      <h1>Associated Features</h1>
      <p>In its most severe forms, agoraphobia can cause individuals to become completely homebound, unable to leave their home and dependent on others for services or assistance to provide even for basic needs. Demoralization and depressive symptoms, as well as abuse of alcohol and sedative medication as inappropriate self-medication strategies, are common.</p>

    <section id="prevalence">
	<div class="contentbox">
    <div class="left">
      <h1>Prevalence</h1>
      <p>Every year approximately 1.7% of adolescents and adults have a diagnosis of agoraphobia. Females are twice as likely as males to experience agoraphobia. Agoraphobia may occur in childhood, but incidence peaks in late adolescence and early adulthood. Twelve-month prevalence in individuals older than 65 years is 0.4%. Prevalence rates do not appear to vary systematically across cultural/racial groups.</p>

    <section id="development-and-course">
	<div class="contentbox">
    <div class="left">
      <h1>Development and Course</h1>
      <p>The percentage of individuals with agoraphobia reporting panic attacks or panic disorder preceding the onset of agoraphobia ranges from 30% in community samples to more than 50% in clinic samples. The majority of individuals with panic disorder show signs of anxiety and agoraphobia before the onset of panic disorder.</p>
      <p>In two-thirds of all cases of agoraphobia, initial onset is before age 35 years. There is a substantial incidence risk in late adolescence and early adulthood, with indications for a second high incidence risk phase after age 40 years. First onset in childhood is rare. The overall mean age at onset for agoraphobia is 17 years, although the age at onset without preceding panic attacks or panic disorder is 25–29 years.</p>
      <p>The course of agoraphobia is typically persistent and chronic. Complete remission is rare (10%), unless the agoraphobia is treated. With more severe agoraphobia, rates of full remission decrease, whereas rates of relapse and chronicity increase.</p>

    <div class="left">
      <h1>Risk and Prognostic Factors</h1>
      <p><strong>Temperamental:</strong> Behavioral inhibition and neurotic disposition (i.e., negative affectivity [neuroticism] and anxiety sensitivity) are closely associated with agoraphobia but are relevant to most anxiety disorders. Anxiety sensitivity (the disposition to believe that symptoms of anxiety are harmful) is also characteristic of individuals with agoraphobia.</p>
      <p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Negative events in childhood (e.g., separation, death of parent) and other stressful events, such as being attacked or mugged, are associated with the onset of agoraphobia. Furthermore, individuals with agoraphobia describe the family climate and child-rearing behavior as being characterized by reduced warmth and increased overprotection.</p>
      <p><strong>Genetic and physiological:</strong> Heritability for agoraphobia is 61%. Of the various phobias, agoraphobia has the strongest and most specific association with the genetic factor that represents proneness to phobias.</p>

      <h1>Cultural Issues</h1>
      <p>The clinical features of agoraphobia are relatively consistent across the lifespan, although the type of agoraphobic situations triggering fear, anxiety, or avoidance, as well as the type of cognitions, may vary. For example, in children, being outside of the home alone is the most frequent situation feared, whereas in older adults, being in shops, standing in line, and being in open spaces are most often feared.</p>

    <div class="left">
      <h1>Functional Consequences</h1>
      <p>Agoraphobia is associated with considerable impairment and disability in terms of role functioning, work productivity, and disability days. Agoraphobia severity is a strong determinant of the degree of disability, irrespective of the presence of comorbid panic disorder, panic attacks, and other comorbid conditions. More than one-third of individuals with agoraphobia are completely homebound and unable to work.</p>

      <h1>Differential Diagnosis</h1>
      <p>Agoraphobia must be distinguished from specific phobia, situational type, separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, and other medical conditions. The diagnosis of agoraphobia should be given only when the fear or avoidance is clearly in excess of that usually associated with these conditions.</p>

      <h1>Comorbidity</h1>
      <p>The majority of individuals with agoraphobia also have other mental disorders. The most frequent additional diagnoses are other anxiety disorders (e.g., specific phobias, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder), depressive disorders (major depressive disorder), PTSD, and alcohol use disorder. Whereas other anxiety disorders frequently precede onset of agoraphobia, depressive disorders and substance use disorders typically occur secondary to agoraphobia.</p>
