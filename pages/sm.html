    <h1>Diagnostic Criteria</h1>
	<div class="contentbox">
    <div>
    <p>312.23 (F94.0)</p>
    <p>A. Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations where speech is expected, despite speaking in other situations (e.g., at school but not at home).</p>
    <p>B. The disturbance interferes significantly with educational achievement, occupational performance, or social communication, making it difficult for children to engage in class activities, complete assignments, or form relationships.</p>
    <p>C. Duration is at least 1 month (not limited to the first month of school); symptoms persist beyond an initial adjustment period.</p>
    <p>D. The failure to speak is not due to a lack of knowledge or comfort with the spoken language required in social situations; the child can speak fluently in other familiar settings.</p>
    <p>E. The disturbance is not better explained by a communication disorder (e.g., childhood-onset fluency disorder) or other conditions like autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders.</p>

  <section id="diagnostic-features">

    <div class="left">
    <h1>Diagnostic Features</h1>
    <p>Children with selective mutism do not initiate or respond verbally in social settings, even though they may speak freely at home. They may use gestures, nodding, or nonverbal sounds like grunts to communicate instead. This condition is frequently associated with extreme social anxiety, and affected children may avoid eye contact, display frozen body language, or withdraw from group activities. Teachers often struggle to evaluate the child's academic progress due to their silence.</p>

    <div class="left">
    <h1>Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis</h1>
    <p>Children with selective mutism often exhibit additional traits, such as excessive shyness, fear of negative evaluation, and reluctance to engage with peers. Social isolation and withdrawal are common, and affected children may cling to parents or display tantrums when pressured to speak. While their language skills are typically normal, subtle communication difficulties may be present. Many children also develop ritualistic behaviors or demonstrate rigidity in their routines.</p>

  <section id="prevalence">
	  	  <div class="contentbox">
    <div class="left">
    <h1>Prevalence</h1>
    <p>Selective mutism is rare, with an estimated point prevalence between 0.03% and 1%, depending on the setting and population studied. It is more commonly diagnosed in young children, particularly before age 5, and appears to affect boys and girls equally. The condition is seen across different racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="development-and-course">
	  	  <div class="contentbox">
    <div>
    <h1>Development and Course</h1>
    <p>The onset typically occurs before age 5, although symptoms often become more apparent when the child enters school and is required to interact in group settings. While some children outgrow the condition as they gain confidence, others continue to struggle with social anxiety into adolescence and adulthood. Without intervention, selective mutism can persist for years and may lead to long-term social and academic challenges.</p>

  <section id="risk-factors">
	  	  <div class="contentbox">
    <div class="left">
    <h1>Risk and Prognostic Factors</h1>
    <p>Temperamental: Children with behavioral inhibition or a predisposition to anxiety are at increased risk. Negative affectivity and heightened sensitivity to new environments may also contribute.</p>
    <p>Environmental: Overprotective or controlling parenting styles can exacerbate the condition. Children may model socially inhibited behavior from parents or caregivers.</p>
    <p>Genetic: Family history of anxiety disorders, particularly social anxiety disorder, suggests a genetic component.</p>

  <section id="culture-diagnostic-issues">
	  	  <div class="contentbox">
    <div>
    <h1>Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues</h1>
    <p>Immigrant children or those from bilingual households may initially refuse to speak in a new language environment. However, selective mutism is diagnosed only when language comprehension is adequate, and refusal to speak persists beyond an adjustment period.</p>
  </div>
	</div>

  <section id="functional-consequences">
	  	  <div class="contentbox">
    <div class="left">
    <h1>Functional Consequences</h1>
    <p>Selective mutism can severely impact a child's academic and social development. In school, children may be unable to ask questions, seek help, or participate in group activities, leading to declining academic performance and frustration. Socially, children may struggle to form friendships, increasing feelings of isolation and vulnerability to bullying. Over time, the condition may contribute to low self-esteem and greater social avoidance.</p>

  <section id="differential-diagnosis">
	  	  <div class="contentbox">
    <div class="left">
    <h1>Differential Diagnosis</h1>
    <p>Communication disorders: Unlike selective mutism, these disorders affect speech across all contexts, not just specific social situations.</p>
    <p>Neurodevelopmental disorders and psychotic disorders: Conditions like autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and severe intellectual disability may impair speech, but selective mutism involves situational silence despite normal speaking ability in other settings.</p>
    <p>Social anxiety disorder (social phobia): Selective mutism often co-occurs with social anxiety disorder. Both diagnoses may apply if social avoidance and extreme anxiety accompany the mutism.</p>

    <div class="left">
    <h1>Comorbidity</h1>
    <p>Selective mutism frequently coexists with other anxiety disorders, particularly social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and specific phobias. Oppositional behaviors, such as defiance or refusal to participate, may occur when children are pressured to speak. Some children may also exhibit language delays or speech sound disorders.</p>
