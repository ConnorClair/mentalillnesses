      <h1>Diagnostic Criteria</h1>
      <p><strong>301.83 (F60.3)</strong></p>
      <p>A pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. (Note: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in Criterion 5.)</li>
        <li>A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation.</li>
        <li>Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.</li>
        <li>Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating). (Note: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in Criterion 5.)</li>
        <li>Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior.</li>
        <li>Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days).</li>
        <li>Chronic feelings of emptiness.</li>
        <li>Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights).</li>
        <li>Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.</li>

      <h1>Diagnostic Features</h1>
      <p>The essential feature of borderline personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity that begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.</p>
      <p>Individuals with borderline personality disorder make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. They are very sensitive to environmental circumstances and experience intense abandonment fears and inappropriate anger even when faced with a realistic time-limited separation or unavoidable changes in plans. They may believe that abandonment implies they are "bad."</p>
      <p>These individuals have a pattern of unstable and intense relationships, often idealizing potential caregivers or lovers at the first meeting but quickly switching to devaluing them. They may empathize with and nurture others but expect the same in return. Their self-image is often unstable, with sudden shifts in goals, values, and vocational aspirations.</p>
      <p>Impulsivity is common in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging, such as spending, sex, substance abuse, or reckless driving. Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats are also common, often precipitated by threats of separation or rejection.</p>

      <h1>Associated Features</h1>
      <p>Individuals with borderline personality disorder may have a pattern of undermining themselves at the moment a goal is about to be realized (e.g., dropping out of school just before graduation). Some individuals develop psychotic-like symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, body-image distortions) during times of stress. Premature death from suicide may occur, especially in those with co-occurring depressive disorders or substance use disorders.</p>
      <p>Physical and sexual abuse, neglect, hostile conflict, and early parental loss are more common in the childhood histories of those with borderline personality disorder. Common co-occurring disorders include depressive and bipolar disorders, substance use disorders, eating disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</p>

    <section id="prevalence">
	<div class="contentbox">
    <div class="left">
      <h1>Prevalence</h1>
      <p>The median population prevalence of borderline personality disorder is estimated to be 1.6% but may be as high as 5.9%. The prevalence is about 6% in primary care settings, about 10% among individuals seen in outpatient mental health clinics, and about 20% among psychiatric inpatients. The prevalence may decrease in older age groups.</p>

    <div class="left">
      <h1>Development and Course</h1>
      <p>The most common pattern is one of chronic instability in early adulthood, with episodes of serious affective and impulsive dyscontrol and high levels of use of health and mental health resources. The impairment from the disorder and the risk of suicide are greatest in the young-adult years and gradually wane with advancing age.</p>
      <p>During their 30s and 40s, the majority of individuals with this disorder attain greater stability in their relationships and vocational functioning. Follow-up studies indicate that after about 10 years, as many as half of the individuals no longer have a pattern of behavior that meets full criteria for borderline personality disorder.</p>

      <h1>Risk and Prognostic Factors</h1>
      <p><strong>Genetic and physiological:</strong> Borderline personality disorder is about five times more common among first-degree biological relatives of those with the disorder than in the general population. There is also an increased familial risk for substance use disorders, antisocial personality disorder, and depressive or bipolar disorders.</p>

      <h1>Cultural Issues</h1>
      <p>The pattern of behavior seen in borderline personality disorder has been identified in many settings around the world. Adolescents and young adults with identity problems (especially when accompanied by substance use) may transiently display behaviors that misleadingly give the impression of borderline personality disorder.</p>

      <h1>Functional Consequences</h1>
      <p>Borderline personality disorder is associated with significant impairment in social, occupational, and other important areas of functioning. Individuals may experience recurrent job losses, interrupted education, and separation or divorce. Physical handicaps may result from self-inflicted abuse behaviors or failed suicide attempts.</p>

      <h1>Differential Diagnosis</h1>
      <p>Borderline personality disorder must be distinguished from depressive and bipolar disorders, other personality disorders, personality change due to another medical condition, substance use disorders, and identity problems. The clinician should avoid giving an additional diagnosis of borderline personality disorder based only on cross-sectional presentation without having documented that the pattern of behavior had an early onset and a long-standing course.</p>

      <h1>Comorbidity</h1>
      <p>Borderline personality disorder frequently co-occurs with depressive and bipolar disorders, substance use disorders, eating disorders (notably bulimia nervosa), posttraumatic stress disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. It also frequently co-occurs with other personality disorders.</p>
