      <h1>Diagnostic Criteria</h1>
      <p><strong>300.02 (F41.1)</strong></p>
      <p>A. Excessive anxiety and worry occurring more days than not for at least 6 months about various events or activities.</p>
      <p>B. Difficulty controlling the worry, leading to distress and impairment.</p>
      <p>C. Anxiety and worry associated with at least three of the following symptoms (only one required in children):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Restlessness or feeling on edge</li>
        <li>Being easily fatigued</li>
        <li>Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank</li>
        <li>Irritability</li>
        <li>Muscle tension</li>
        <li>Sleep disturbances (difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>D. The anxiety causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</p>
      <p>E. The disturbance is not due to a substance, medication, or medical condition.</p>
      <p>F. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="diagnostic-features">
      <h1>Diagnostic Features</h1>
      <p>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive worry about various aspects of daily life, including work, health, finances, and relationships. The anxiety is chronic, difficult to control, and often disproportionate to actual risks. Individuals with GAD tend to anticipate disaster and may struggle to focus due to persistent worry.</p>
      <p>Physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, and muscle tension often accompany the anxiety, contributing to overall distress.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="associated-features">
      <h1>Associated Features</h1>
      <p>Individuals with GAD may experience persistent muscle tension, trembling, twitching, sweating, nausea, dizziness, and exaggerated startle responses. Many report difficulty relaxing and feeling constantly "on edge." Additionally, somatic symptoms like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and headaches are common.</p>
      <p>GAD is often associated with perfectionism, excessive reassurance-seeking, and difficulty tolerating uncertainty.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="prevalence">
      <h1>Prevalence</h1>
      <p>The 12-month prevalence of GAD in the United States is approximately 0.9% among adolescents and 2.9% among adults. Globally, prevalence rates range from 0.4% to 3.6%. Females are twice as likely as males to be diagnosed with GAD. The disorder is most commonly diagnosed in middle age, with prevalence decreasing in older populations.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="development-and-course">
      <h1>Development and Course</h1>
      <p>GAD often develops gradually, with symptoms appearing in childhood or adolescence but intensifying in adulthood. The median age of onset is approximately 30 years. The disorder tends to be chronic, with symptoms fluctuating in intensity over time.</p>
      <p>Children with GAD may exhibit excessive worry about school performance, punctuality, and catastrophic events, whereas older adults may focus on health concerns and family issues.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="risk-factors">
      <h1>Risk and Prognostic Factors</h1>
      <p><strong>Temperamental:</strong> Behavioral inhibition, negative affectivity, and harm avoidance contribute to GAD risk.</p>
      <p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Childhood trauma, parental overprotection, and chronic stress are linked to GAD development.</p>
      <p><strong>Genetic:</strong> GAD has a hereditary component, with approximately one-third of risk attributed to genetic factors. Shared genetic pathways exist with other anxiety and mood disorders.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="functional-consequences">
      <h1>Functional Consequences</h1>
      <p>Generalized Anxiety Disorder can significantly impact daily functioning, making it difficult to complete tasks efficiently. Individuals may struggle with concentration, decision-making, and social interactions due to persistent worry and anxiety. Workplace performance and academic achievement may suffer, leading to increased stress and frustration. Additionally, GAD can lead to avoidance behaviors, where individuals steer clear of situations that trigger anxiety, further limiting their personal and professional growth.</p>
      <p>Physical health may also be affected, with chronic stress contributing to issues such as hypertension, digestive problems, and weakened immune response. Over time, these effects can lower the overall quality of life and increase the risk of developing other mental health disorders, including depression.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="differential-diagnosis">
      <h1>Differential Diagnosis</h1>
      <p>GAD must be distinguished from conditions such as panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Unlike panic disorder, which involves sudden intense fear episodes, GAD is characterized by ongoing, excessive worry. Social anxiety disorder primarily involves fear of social interactions, while GAD covers a broader range of concerns. OCD involves intrusive, distressing thoughts and compulsive behaviors that differentiate it from GAD.</p>
      <p>Additionally, GAD can sometimes be confused with depression, as both conditions involve excessive worry and difficulty concentrating. However, individuals with depression typically experience persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, which are not primary symptoms of GAD.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="comorbidity">
      <h1>Comorbidity</h1>
      <p>GAD frequently coexists with other mental health conditions, particularly depression, panic disorder, and substance use disorders. Many individuals with GAD also experience other anxiety disorders, such as social anxiety disorder or specific phobias. The overlap of symptoms can sometimes complicate diagnosis and treatment.</p>
      <p>Additionally, individuals with GAD are at increased risk of developing physical health problems, including cardiovascular issues, chronic pain conditions, and gastrointestinal disorders, due to chronic stress. Addressing these comorbid conditions is essential for effective treatment and long-term well-being.</p>
