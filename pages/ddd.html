      <h1>Diagnostic Criteria</h1>
      <p><strong>300.6 (F48.1)</strong></p>
      <p>A. The presence of persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Depersonalization:</strong> Experiences of unreality, detachment, or being an outside observer with respect to one’s thoughts, feelings, sensations, body, or actions (e.g., perceptual alterations, distorted sense of time, unreal or absent self, emotional and/or physical numbing).</li>
        <li><strong>Derealization:</strong> Experiences of unreality or detachment with respect to surroundings (e.g., individuals or objects are experienced as unreal, dreamlike, foggy, lifeless, or visually distorted).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>B. During the depersonalization or derealization experiences, reality testing remains intact.</p>
      <p>C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</p>
      <p>D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, medication) or another medical condition (e.g., seizures).</p>
      <p>E. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as schizophrenia, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or another dissociative disorder.</p>

      <h1>Diagnostic Features</h1>
      <p>The essential features of depersonalization/derealization disorder are persistent or recurrent episodes of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Episodes of depersonalization are characterized by a feeling of unreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, one’s whole self or from aspects of the self. The individual may feel detached from his or her entire being (e.g., “I am no one,” “I have no self”). He or she may also feel subjectively detached from aspects of the self, including feelings, thoughts, whole body or body parts, or sensations. There may also be a diminished sense of agency (e.g., feeling robotic, like an automaton; lacking control of one’s speech or movements).</p>
      <p>Episodes of derealization are characterized by a feeling of unreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, the world, be it individuals, inanimate objects, or all surroundings. The individual may feel as if he or she were in a fog, dream, or bubble, or as if there were a veil or a glass wall between the individual and world around. Surroundings may be experienced as artificial, colorless, or lifeless.</p>

      <h1>Associated Features</h1>
      <p>Individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder may have difficulty describing their symptoms and may think they are “crazy” or “going crazy.” Another common experience is the fear of irreversible brain damage. A commonly associated symptom is a subjectively altered sense of time (i.e., too fast or too slow), as well as a subjective difficulty in vividly recalling past memories and owning them as personal and emotional. Vague somatic symptoms, such as head fullness, tingling, or lightheadedness, are not uncommon. Individuals may suffer extreme rumination or obsessional preoccupation (e.g., constantly obsessing about whether they really exist, or checking their perceptions to determine whether they appear real). Varying degrees of anxiety and depression are also common associated features.</p>

    <section id="prevalence">
	<div class="contentbox">
    <div class="left">
      <h1>Prevalence</h1>
      <p>Transient depersonalization/derealization symptoms lasting hours to days are common in the general population. The 12-month prevalence of depersonalization/derealization disorder is thought to be markedly less than for transient symptoms, although precise estimates for the disorder are unavailable. In general, approximately one-half of all adults have experienced at least one lifetime episode of depersonalization/derealization. However, symptomatology that meets full criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder is markedly less common than transient symptoms. Lifetime prevalence in U.S. and non-U.S. countries is approximately 2% (range of 0.8% to 2.8%). The gender ratio for the disorder is 1:1.</p>

    <section id="development-and-course">
	<div class="contentbox">
    <div class="left">
      <h1>Development and Course</h1>
      <p>The mean age at onset of depersonalization/derealization disorder is 16 years, although the disorder can start in early or middle childhood; a minority cannot recall ever not having had the symptoms. Less than 20% of individuals experience onset after age 20 years and only 5% after age 25 years. Onset in the fourth decade of life or later is highly unusual. Onset can range from extremely sudden to gradual. Duration of depersonalization/derealization disorder episodes can vary greatly, from brief (hours or days) to prolonged (weeks, months, or years).</p>
      <p>The course of the disorder is often persistent. About one-third of cases involve discrete episodes; another third, continuous symptoms from the start; and still another third, an initially episodic course that eventually becomes continuous. While in some individuals the intensity of symptoms can wax and wane considerably, others report an unwavering level of intensity that in extreme cases can be constantly present for years or decades.</p>

    <div class="left">
      <h1>Risk and Prognostic Factors</h1>
      <p><strong>Temperamental:</strong> Individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder are characterized by harm-avoidant temperament, immature defenses, and both disconnection and overconnection schemata. Immature defenses such as idealization/devaluation, projection and acting out result in denial of reality and poor adaptation.</p>
      <p><strong>Environmental:</strong> There is a clear association between the disorder and childhood interpersonal traumas in a substantial portion of individuals, although this association is not as prevalent or as extreme in the nature of the traumas as in other dissociative disorders, such as dissociative identity disorder. In particular, emotional abuse and emotional neglect have been most strongly and consistently associated with the disorder.</p>

      <h1>Cultural Issues</h1>
      <p>Volitionally induced experiences of depersonalization/derealization can be a part of meditative practices that are prevalent in many religions and cultures and should not be diagnosed as a disorder. However, there are individuals who initially induce these states intentionally but over time lose control over them and may develop a fear and aversion for related practices.</p>

      <h1>Functional Consequences</h1>
      <p>Symptoms of depersonalization/derealization disorder are highly distressing and are associated with major impairment in social, occupational, and other important areas of functioning. The emotional flattening and behavioral inhibition that individuals often demonstrate may appear incongruent with the extreme emotional pain reported by those with the disorder. Impairment is often experienced in both interpersonal and occupational spheres, largely due to the hypoemotionality with others, subjective difficulty in focusing and retaining information, and a general sense of disconnectedness from life.</p>

      <h1>Differential Diagnosis</h1>
      <p>Depersonalization/derealization disorder must be distinguished from conditions such as illness anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, other dissociative disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, substance/medication-induced disorders, and mental disorders due to another medical condition. The presence of intact reality testing specifically regarding the depersonalization/derealization symptoms is essential to differentiating depersonalization/derealization disorder from psychotic disorders.</p>

      <h1>Comorbidity</h1>
      <p>In a convenience sample of adults recruited for a number of depersonalization research studies, lifetime comorbidities were high for unipolar depressive disorder and for any anxiety disorder, with a significant proportion of the sample having both disorders. Comorbidity with posttraumatic stress disorder was low. The three most commonly co-occurring personality disorders were avoidant, borderline, and obsessive-compulsive.</p>
